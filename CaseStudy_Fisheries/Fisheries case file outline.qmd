Stock chosen: Early Stewart

## 1. Basic Ricker Model

```{r}

## 2. Alternate Models

### Alternate 1: Power model

This alternate model is basically shows that log(recruiters) depends on log(spawners) in the form of a power model. Recall that an alternative stock-recruit model is a simple power model, which does not assume density dependence.

$$
R_i = A S_i^B
$$

which is linearized to: $$
ln(R_i) = A+B*ln(S_i)
$$

This model form uses the same lognormal likelihood as above, and has normal priors on both A and B: $$
A \sim normal(\mu_{A}, \tau_{A}) 
$$ $$
B \sim normal(\mu_{B}, \tau_{B})
$$ And the same gamma prior on precision as the above models.

Note: Jake Lawlor wrote an exploratory R script where he found a significant 1:1 relationship using the lm() function. The explanatory power is 69% (R2).

### Alternate 2: Power model with environmental covariates

This alternate model is an extension to the previous power model using environmental covariates. Brooke Davis suggested the average ($esst$) of April ($apesst$), May ($maesst$), and June ($jnesst$) sea surface temperatures is an important environmental factor.

Extending the power model to include this environmental covariate:

$$
R_i = A S_i^{B+esst}
$$

which is linearized to: $$
ln(R_i) = A+B*ln(S_i)+ln(esst)
$$
